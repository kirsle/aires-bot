This "lib" folder contains a bulk of the third-party modules required for AiRS
to work well. You may still need to manually install the following modules:

  XML::Parser          (required for AIM listener)
  Crypt::SSLeay        (required for YMSG listener)
  LWP::Protocol::https (required for YMSG listener)
