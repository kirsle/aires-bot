# Chatterbot Configuration File
#
# This file represents a single chatterbot. A "chatterbot" in this context
# refers to one bot that has its own unique name and personality (including
# reply base). One chatterbot may have multiple connections to multiple
# listeners. This means you only need multiple chatterbots if you are running
# multiple distinct robot personalities.

	#   n) Any params this brain requires (for e.g. RiveScript requires the
	#      directory where your *.rs files are stored)
	# The RiveScript brain is used by default. The Eliza one is here too,
	# commented out, for another example. You can only specify ONE brain at
	# a time!
