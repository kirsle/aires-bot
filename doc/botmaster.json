# Botmaster configuration for AiRS.
#
# This file defines who the botmaster of your bot is. The botmaster is you, the
# owner of the bot.
#
# AiRS signs on to multiple messaging protocols, for example, AOL Instant
# Messenger. If you, the botmaster, have an AIM screen name, you should add it
# to this config file. The format for a user name is as follows:
#
#   LISTENER-username
#
# The LISTENER is always in all caps, and the username is always lowercased.
# Here are examples:
#
#   AIM-botmaster12
#   MSN-botmaster12@live.com
#   IRC-botmaster12
#   ICQ-123456789
#
# Take notice that some messengers are "less secure" than others. For example,
# on IRC, you should make sure that your botmaster nick is registered so that
# nobody else can use it.
[
	# These are examples, and are commented out so they don't take effect.
	# "AIM-botmaster12",
	# "MSN-botmaster12@live.com",
