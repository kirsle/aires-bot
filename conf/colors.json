# Color configuration for AiRS.
#
# AiRS tries to print colorful messages to your terminal or other front-end. It
# supports the 16 ANSI colors. For its own printing, though, it gives aliases to
# the colors so that you, the user, can customize the colors to your liking.
#
# The supported ANSI colors are:
#
#  black   gray
#  maroon  red
#  green   lime
#  gold    yellow
#  purple  magenta
#  navy    blue
#  teal    cyan
#  silver  white
#  clear
#
# "clear" just resets the color to your terminal's default.
